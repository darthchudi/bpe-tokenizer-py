# Byte-Pair Encoding Tokenizer 

This is an implementation of the byte-pair encoding algorithm, which has been adapted for tokenization. 

The implemented tokenizer produces sub-word tokens when tokenizing a given input sequence.

A vocabulary interface is also implemented, which handles mapping between subword tokens and their corresponding indices in the vocabulary.
